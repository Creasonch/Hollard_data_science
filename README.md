# Hollard data science

## Case study:
Use the following dataset 'data.csv' to build a binary classification model in a python 3.9 environment.

The objective is to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not. You will have to predict the probability of having at least one claim over the insured period of the building. The model will be based on the building characteristics. The target variable, Claim, is a 1 if the building has at least a claim over the insured period and 0 if the building doesnâ€™t have a claim over the insured period.

Please comment your code explaining your decision making process. The only mandatory requirements are the ROC curves and AUC value for both the build and test datasets.
Your scripts must be sent in a text file format along with a requirements.txt file containing the versions of the libraries used.
