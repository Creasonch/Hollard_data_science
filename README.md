# Hollard data science

## Case study:
Use the following dataset 'data.csv' to build a binary classification model in a python environment.

The objective is  to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not. You will have to predict the probability of having at least one claim over the insured period of the building.The model will be based on the building characteristics. The target variable, Claim, is a:

1 if the building has at least a claim over the insured period.
0 if the building doesnâ€™t have a claim over the insured period.

You will be required to explain your development process, thus your scripts should generate any visualisations that influenced your decision-making.

Please include ROC curves for both the build and test datasets and compute their respective AUC values.
