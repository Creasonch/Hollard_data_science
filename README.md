# Hollard data science

## Case study:
Use the following training data 'train_data.csv' to build a classification model in a python environment.
You will be required to explain your development process, thus your scripts should generate any visualisations that influenced your decision-making.

Please include ROC curves for both the build and test datasets and compute their respective AUC values.
